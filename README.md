# Data analysis project
This project was developed as part of the final selection round for the sponsored Scot Forge project. The notebook demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and the application of machine learning algorithms.

## 📌 What this project is

A compact data analysis project containing an interactive Jupyter notebook (`Data_analysis.ipynb`) with exploratory data analysis, visualisations, and modelling notes, plus a PDF report (`Data Analysis Project Report.pdf`) that documents results and conclusions. A separate `powerbi.pdf` contains Power BI artifacts or screenshots exported to PDF.

This repo is aimed at data analysts, students, and reviewers who want to inspect the analysis, reproduce results or adapt it for similar datasets.

## 🚀 Quick start — open and run the notebook

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux (zsh)
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows (PowerShell)
```

2. Install recommended Python packagesusing the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start Jupyter and open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab          # or `jupyter notebook`
```

Then open `Data_analysis.ipynb` in the browser and run the cells (Kernel → Restart & Run All) to reproduce the analysis.

## 📄 What you'll find in the notebook

- Data loading and cleaning steps
- Exploratory data analysis (summary statistics, missing data checks)
- Visualisations (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation matrices)
- Modelling/analysis steps performed (regressions, classification, clustering, etc.)
- Conclusions and next steps documented in Markdown cells

Open the first few cells to see data sources and any configuration you must set.
